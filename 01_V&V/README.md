# Verification and Validation Cases

This directory collects the V&V setups used with `reactingPimpleCentralFoam`.

- `inletL_reactingPimple_lit`: baseline lit case.
- `inletL_reactingPimple_lit_viscousTurb`: duplicated baseline case for viscous and turbulence studies.

The mesh directory `constant/polyMesh` is intentionally excluded to keep the repository size manageable. Supply the mesh from your local setup before running either case.
